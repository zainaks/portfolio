            <h3>Problem Statement</h3>
            <p>Neurodivergent students often face accessibility gaps when searching for resources, which can impact their well-being and academic success. </p>
        </div>

        <div class="teamClient">
            <h3>Goal of Study</h3>
            <p> This study <b>explored challenges faced by neurodivergent students</b> at the University of Michigan, primarily analyzing the effectiveness of current mental and academic support services provided, with the intent to uncover user needs that could guide improvements in service accessibility, delivery, and design.</p>
            <h3>Methodology</h3>
            <p><b>Photo-elicitation</b> (the use of visual stimuli to capture information) was used to conduct qualitative interviews. Thematic analyses of participant transcripts were then coded into an affinity diagram.</p>
        </div>

            <h3>The Interview Process</h3>
            <p>Five participants consented to virtual 45-minute interviews.
                Using an <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oNDgtodEwHQhFgt0T2LGZIw0xMfEaTfr/edit">interview guide made on Google Docs</a>, and a curated set of ten photos on academic and social life, 
                I prompted the participants to reflect on their personal experiences and challenges.
            </p>
            <h3>Coding and Analysis</h3>
            <p>Interview transcripts were then reviewed using thematic analysis, i.e examining data to identify reoccuring themes. 
                Coding, or organizing data sets with labels, was done through Google Docs. 
                Key patterns and themes were later organized into an <b>affinity diagram, shown below.</b>
                This visual map organized the data into three overarching themes that each reference direct quotations from the interviewees.</p>

            <h3>User insights</h3>
            <p>Users reported depression and anxiety, worsened by challenges adjusting to the large, overstimulating campus. Several faced difficulties 
                with traditional talk therapy provided by the campus, feeling the need to "mask”, despite the therapeutic environment, due to therapists' limited understanding of neurodivergence.
                Executive dysfunctions, communication barriers, and the absence of supportive communities further compounded their struggles.
            </p>
            <h3>Recommendations</h3>
            <p>These user insights have highlighted a key gap within University support systems, particularly in communication designs and service accessibility. These insights could beneficially guide future UX efforts, such as redesigning the university’s counseling system to add specialties for neurodivergent students, creating more accessible course environments, or co-designing real community groups that foster safe, unmasked interaction.</b></p>
            <h3>What This Taught Me About UX</h3>
            <p> This project strengthened my ability to conduct user-centered research through open-ended interviews, thematic analysis, and affinity mapping. I additionally developed a deeper understanding of emotional and cognitive user needs that directly inform how I approach accessible and inclusive UX design today, especially among users who function differently than others.</p>
